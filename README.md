# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship
This project is the work of the virtual internship program. The program consists of 3 modules- 1. Data Quality Assessment, 2. Data Insights, 3. Data Insights &amp; Presentations. The tasks involved analyzing the customer and transaction data of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. The client provided KPMG with 4 large datasets: 
The first module involved the task of data cleaning and preprocessing of the given datasets for further analysis. I have used MS Excel for this purpose.
The second module required Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation to recommend which of the 1000 new customers from the new customers' list should be targeted to drive the most value for the organization. Here, I have conducted RFM Analysis for customer segmentation and created a PowerPoint presentation for the important information.
The third and final module involved creating a Dashboard with data summary and results.
